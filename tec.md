# Our three agreements (TEC)

At Makers Academy we have three agreements that guide our actions. We expect every person at Makers Academy to uphold to these values every day, starting today, during your PreCourse, course and hopefully the rest of your professional life.

## The First Agreement: Transparency

Transparency, in its simplest form, means to be honest; with yourself and others.

Learning how to code in 12 weeks is a crazy thing. For you to be able to achieve this, we need you to work with everyone, follow our way and agree to adhere to the rules that govern Makers Academy. Our code of conduct supports an optimal learning environment that ensures that everyone gets the most out of the learning experience.

We expect you to be transparent in:
- showing up on time
- working through the projects and challenges you are given each week/day
- communicating when you are struggling
- pair programming with others
- asking for help
- submitting feedback
- going the steps outlined in each project/challenge

Part of being transparent meant that when you fall out of it (_for whichever reasons_) you will be responsible for getting back. Most of the time all it takes is acknowledging the situation and moving on.

## The Second Agreement: Effort

This may be the most straight-forward agreement. In essence, we expect you to bring your whole self (your intelligence, focus, creativity, and personality) into each and every day. This means that we expect you to do your best. If you are struggling, we expect you to ask others (including any staff member) for help.

We expect everyone to complete the projects and challenges, but we want to reinforce that it's not about completing them if nothing is learned. Fundamentally your time at Makers Academy is about learning.

## The Third Agreement: Compassion

We also expect every person to be compassionate to one another. Compassion does not mean **nice**, they are actually not the same thing. Being compassionate does mean being friendly, generous, and considerate, but it does not preclude giving constructive, truthful feedback as long as it is **A** ctionable, **S** pecific, and **K** ind (_ASK_).

We expect all of you and coaches to show compassion by providing feedback and code reviews to one another, informing one another when someone has fallen out of integrity, and by bringing ourselves 100% into each challenge every day. We also show compassion through showing respect to others and our space.

Last but not least, we expect you to be compassionate to yourself. You've taken a big risk and are making a big change. Give yourself some space and understanding as you face the challenges of our program.
