# Ruby

Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro _"Matz"_ Matsumoto, blended parts of his favourite languages ( _Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp_ ) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.

So Ruby is an all purpose programming language, in short a language that lets you program anything you can imagine ( _you can even create iPhone and iPad applications with Ruby!_ ). On top of that it is a beautiful and simple language that lets you write elegant code.

So you already know some Ruby because in preparation for your interview you completed [Chris Pine's Learn To Program book](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) up to chapter 8 and the [Codecademy Ruby Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby).

*If it has been a long time since you had your interview, please do one of the basic tutorials listed below before moving on to the first Ruby challenge.*

The next three weeks you will be working hard to understand as much Ruby as possible. Please refer to the [learning objectives](learning_objectives.md) for the base level you **must** achieve.

You may also find the following resources helpful to get yourself ready:

## Pills
Strings, Arrays and Hashes are the three data classes that you will be likely to use more than any other. These pills give a basic overview, but we recommend that you strive to learn every available method for all 3 classes.
