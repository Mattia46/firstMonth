# Ruby

Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro _"Matz"_ Matsumoto, blended parts of his favourite languages ( _Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp_ ) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.

So Ruby is an all purpose programming language, in short a language that lets you program anything you can imagine ( _you can even create iPhone and iPad applications with Ruby!_ ). On top of that it is a beautiful and simple language that lets you write elegant code.

So you already know some Ruby because in preparation for your interview you completed [Chris Pine's Learn To Program book](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) up to chapter 8 and the [Codecademy Ruby Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby).  

If it has been a long time since you read the Learn To Program book, or did the Codecademy Ruby Track then we recommend that you re-do them in order to ensure their contents are up to date in your mind.  And when we say do, in the case of the Learn To Program, **it is absolutely critical that you not only read, but type out every code example out yourself** and run them via the command line, or using the [interactive ruby interpreter (IRB)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell).  You must actively type the code in order to learn at the most accelerated rate.

The next three weeks you will be working hard to understand as much Ruby as possible.  Please refer to the [learning objectives](learning_objectives.md) for the base level you **must** achieve. You may also find the following pills and tutorials helpful to get yourself ready:

## Pills

Strings, Arrays and Hashes are the three data classes that you will be likely to use more than any other. These pills give a basic overview, but we recommend that you strive to learn every available method for all 3 classes.

### Wanna try something different? Do some Zen Ruby :)

A challenging and interesting Ruby tutorial, that also teaches you about error messages and TDD. It seems a little confusing at the start, but once you get going, it's a phenomenal resource. Many graduates name this as one of their favourite tutorials from their early days.
