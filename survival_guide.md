# Survival Guide

Your journey to become a web developer is going to be a fun and exciting one but it's also going to be hard. We've put together a few tips that we hope to make your life a little easier during the PreCourse.

### Focus on your own progress
 You're going to find yourself thinking that everyone else in your cohort is doing better than you. Stop it. It's detrimental to your learning. By comparing yourself to others you're not taking ownership of your progress. Instead of fretting about what you *think* others know better than you, you should ask yourself *"What do I know now that I didn't know a couple of days ago?"*. This is why we have... [LEARNING OBJECTIVES!](learning_objectives.md) Use them. Frequently check how confident you are with the concepts listed there and you'll be surprised how much you are actually learning.

### Keep us in the loop
*Lack of communication is the #1 reason people don't make it through the PreCourse.*

So you didn't finish a challenge? Reach out and let us know what's happening. You feel like you're falling behind? Get in touch! Your cat got sick and you can't focus on the challenges? We might be able to help, somehow.

### Balance work/rest
Here at Makers we are big believers that wellbeing and happiness lead to better learning. That's why we recommend you don't forget to do 3 very simple things: Exercise, Sleep and Meditation.

**Exercise:** Your brain needs rest and your body needs to move. Otherwise you'll find yourself buzzing with physical energy and mentally drained, which might cause insomnia or poor quality of sleep. [There's also evidence that regular exercise improves memory and thinking](http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/regular-exercise-changes-brain-improve-memory-thinking-skills-201404097110), so make sure you find time to put your trainers on and get moving!

**Sleep:** Coding until late hours might sound like a good idea but getting enough sleep is crucial for your learning. This [3' coursera video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/AsWfx/the-importance-of-sleep-in-learning) explains it quite well.

**Meditation and Mindfulness:** Not only are they super useful in helping you maintain a healthy balanced mind, it's also been proven that [meditative practice can actually change the brain for better focus and memory](http://healthland.time.com/2012/08/10/can-meditation-make-you-smarter/). Apps like [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) are a great way to get into it.  


### Get into a regular Working Pattern
The PreCourse is now your part-time job (or even full-time, for those of you already quit their jobs), so try to stick to a daily routine. Work on something everyday, even if you only have 10 minutes to spare because at this stage it's super important that you're exposed to the concepts you're learning on a daily basis. So, if you don't have a lot of time on your hands, try to do (or redo) a [Codewars kata](https://www.codewars.com/), for example.

### Meet up during the PreCourse
*Don't work in isolation!*

Use any opportunity you have to pair with your peers. Getting into [pair-programming](pills/pairing.md) now will make it a lot easier for when the course starts, since you'll be pairing all day, everyday. Meet up in the evenings / weekends and code together.  

Unfortunately, we're short on space in the Makers HQ, so it won't be possible to get together until the course starts. But don't you worry, pair-programming doesn't have to be face to face, there are many tools out there that allow you to pair remotely. Here's a few we can recommend:

- [Screen Hero](https://screenhero.com/)
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)
- [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/)
- [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/)

If you are still keen on meeting face to face, there are a bunch of great places around here with great coffee and good wifi that we can recommend:

- [Ace Hotel](https://www.acehotel.com/london)
- [Google Campus](https://www.campus.co/london/en)
- [Trade](http://www.trade-made.co.uk/)
- [Java U](http://www.java-u.co.uk/)

### Blogging

Lots of you have come across blogs from several Makers alumni. The reason there are so many is because we highly recommend you get into blogging about your experience as early as possible. Writing is a great brain-dumping exercise, as it helps you clear the mind and articulate your thoughts and regular writing as shown an positive impact on [mental and physical wellbeing](http://psychcentral.com/lib/the-health-benefits-of-journaling/).

And if these reasons weren't enough to get you excited, what if we told you that **there's a prize for the best blog on each cohort**? Yeah, we're cool like that.

Go on, set your blog up! There are several cool platforms out there to choose from: [Medium](https://medium.com/), [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or any other you might know and fancy. If you decide to write on Medium, you can contribute to the Makers Academy blog as a Guest Writer to increase your own online presence.
