# Mentoring

Makers Academy encourages mentoring as building connections between students in different stages of the course. The idea is that both parties can benefit from the relationship. Besides just having an extra person to talk to, there are three main advantages:

### 1. Advice

Mentors are students from the cohort above, which means a Mentor can relate to where a Mentee is, since the mentor was there just 6 weeks ago - so Mentees ask them for advice. Whether it's about what to do, how best to prepare, any tips on making the most of the PreCourse, even good places to go for lunch around the office... Mentors are an ocean of useful advice!

### 2. Technical issues

While it's not your Mentors job to teach you, there may be technical issues that you have that they can help with, or if nothing else they will be able to advise you on how/where to go to find the answers to your problems. Wandering why your iterator is always returning nil? Ask! Can't decide on whether it's better to go deeper into Ruby or get started on TDD? Ask! The Mentors have been there and got the t-shirt, and it's amazing how much they've learnt in the past 6 weeks.

### 3. Pair partners

As we say to our students time and again - the best way to learn is to try explaining things to others. We highly recommend that Mentees come to Makers for an hour or so a week to pair with their Mentor on the pre-course materials or on writing some simple Ruby programs. It will help the Mentor to solidify what they've been learning and it will allow the Mentee to work with someone who is a little further on their coding journey. If evenings don't work (We're open until 8.30pm every day) then weekends might be an option, and if you aren't in London, google 'remote pairing' - there are programs like ScreenHero and CodeBox and many more that you could try out to support "Online Pairing".

When you have passed the PreCourse, you will be given the opportunity to become a mentor yourself - so you can really discover the benefits of learning through coaching in a pair programming environment.

## How to get started

We ask students from the cohort above you to sign up to become mentors. Towards the end of **week 2** you'll be sent a sign-up sheet with all the mentors in one of the usual PreCourse emails and you'll be asked to find a mentor from that list. Once you reached out to them on Slack and you agreed on something, add your name to the sign-up sheet next to your mentor's. *Everyone on that list wants to become a mentor and they are expecting you to get in touch, so don't worry about reaching out to them!*

If you have any additional questions about mentoring, pair programming or online pairing, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us.
