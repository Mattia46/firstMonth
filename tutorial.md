# Tutorial week

First things first - if you haven't read the [intro doc](ruby.md) to Ruby, please do so before continuing.

Ok, this week's about completing a Ruby tutorial of your choice. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Choose one of these Ruby tutorials to complete. We suggest you give each one a go for 10-20 min and stick to the one that resonates more with you.

  - [Chris Pine’s Learn to Program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz17qR4zZedib0M5RnRwWFl3MUk/view) - All of it
  - [Ruby Kickstart](https://github.com/JoshCheek/ruby-kickstart) - At least Chapter 1, 2 and 3
  - [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/) - At least until chapter 40
<br>
<br>
2. Depending on your chosen tutorial, create a Github repo with using the following names **EXACTLY** (we won't be able to track your progress properly, otherwise):

  - `learn-to-program`
  - `ruby-kickstart`
  - `lrthw`    
<br>
<br>
3. Create a folder on your machine with the same name as your repo and then, every time you start a new chapter, create a folder for that chapter and a file for each exercise you might do. You'll end up with a directory tree similar to this:
```shell
  lrthw   
  ├── chap01   
  │   ├── ex1.rb  
  │   └── ex2.rb  
  └── chap02  
      ├── ex1.rb  
      └── ex2.rb
```
<br>
<br>
4. Push your answers and exercise attempts to your newly created repo. Do it frequently, we recommend you do it every time you complete an exercise.

## Important:

- Whichever tutorial you choose, **it is absolutely critical that you not only read, but type out every code example yourself** and run them via the command line, or using the [interactive ruby interpreter (IRB)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell). You must actively type the code in order to learn at the most accelerated rate.

- **DO  NOT COPY-PASTE!** Mr Zed A. Shaw explains why so perfectly in [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/intro.html), that we might as well just quote him:

    >*You must type each of these exercises in, manually. If you copy and paste, you might as well not even do them. The point of these exercises is to train your hands, your brain, and your mind in how to read, write, and see code. If you copy-paste, you are cheating yourself out of the effectiveness of the lessons.*

-  It's better that you cover all chapters, and review the available solutions for any exercises that you cannot complete in **under 45 minutes**. Please do not look at any solution until you have at least tried each exercise.
