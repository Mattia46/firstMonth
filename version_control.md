# Version Control

Version control is the process and technology used to "control" various "versions" of the code that you write. If, for example, you were building a house, you'd likely start with the foundation and make sure it's solid before you started building the walls. You'd want to stop after the walls were built to make sure everything lined up properly before adding the roof. You wouldn't want to build the entire thing and *realise* after the roof is built that there is a crack in the foundation.

Software version control helps us avoid these problems by allowing us to keep various versions of what we're building. If we *realise* we've made a mistake, we can revert back to a previous version that we know is solid.

Additionally, version control allows multiple versions to be built simultaneously and then brought together. It doesn't matter whether you're working in a team or writing code alone, version control is something you absolutely need to understand.

## Git

One of the most common version control system used by developers is git. With git you get all the benefits of controlling various versions of your code and the ability to handle distributed work amongst your team. [This isn't the only version control software](http://www.infoq.com/articles/dvcs-guide) out there, but it's what a large portion of software developers use and it's what we're going to cover here.

At this point you should have git installed (if you don't, it comes as part of [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)).

You can check if git is installed by asking for its version:

````
$ git --version
git version 1.7.12.4 (Apple Git-37)
````
