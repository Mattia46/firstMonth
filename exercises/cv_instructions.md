# How to write your github CV

We ask you to complete draft 1 of your CV on the pre-course so that you start thinking about skills you're keen to develop on the course, projects you're keen to showcase and so that you start thinking about what kind of job you want to do as early as possible. We will review and update your CVs in week 6. 

Many of you will have some form of CV but at Makers Academy we use github CVs. We do this so that it's quick and easy for us to send your CV to our hiring partners (which happens week 12 onwards) and also so that they can flick through your commit history, your final projects and your side projects all in one place. 

Hint: this is why it's really important to [clean up your READMEs](https://github.com/makersacademy/jobhunters/blob/master/clean_your_github.md) as you go. Don't leave it until the end of the course. 

### Creating your github CV
Feel free to do this on your own, or pair up. Total time to complete this is 2-3 hours. 

#### Step 1 - 5 mins

Take a moment to remind yourself what the point of a CV is. 
The purpose of a CV is to provide evidence about why you'd be suitable for a particular job. 

#### Step 2 - 10 mins
Take a moment to see what other people have done:
- Viola
- Shane
- Yas
- Sophy 

#### Step 3 - 5 mins
Answer these questions:
- What do you notice about these CVs? What is different about these CVs?
- Write your own list of Do's and Don'ts for your CV. 
- We've put one together here if you want a cheat sheet

#### Step 3 - 1-2 hours
- Now write a first draft of your CV
- We have created a CV template below but feel free to do your own thing
- Here is the template: https://github.com/makersacademy/cv
- Fork it 
- Please don't rename the repo - leave it as /cv

#### Extra notes
- At this stage don't worry too much about the technical skills section - you can add this later when we review in week 6 and 12
- The purpose of your Github is to show your approach, not your technical skill. Most employers recruiting at your level are less interested in your actual technical skill today, and much more interested in how you approach writing and designing code (and how you solve problems).
- For your READMES: on the (two or three) repos youâ€™re super proud of, use the README to explain (briefly) what makes you special: different from other devs (or other Makers):
* your motivations;
* the design;
* any alternatives you explored or could have explored;
* your thinking;
* issues you faced, and how you overcame them; and
* anything else you think will help to show how awesome you are.

#### Step 4 - 20 mins
Ask someone you know well to review it. Ask them:
- Does it sound like me? 
- Have I missed anything out e.g. things I'm good at?

#### Step 5 - Submit!

Congratulations! You have completed your first draft! We will review these in week 6 and again in week 12.
