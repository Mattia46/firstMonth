# CV notes

Here is a list of Do's and Don'ts we've compiled at Makers. It's not exhaustive but it's a good start. 

##### CV Do's
- Make it read like a newspaper - most important, unique and relevant stuff first
- include transferrable skills from your previous career
- Use STAR technique for including specific details or evidence for the points you're making about yourself e.g. details that back up how much/how often/how many (see below)
- always include anything maths, engineering, science, Computer science related - even if it's 'unfinished' e.g. 1 year of an engineering degree, a side interest in design or hardware
- make your opening 'profile paragraph' super personal and relevant to the job you're applying to
- put everything in reverse chronological history
- include a list of interests/hobbies - these are great conversation starters at interviews and humanise you
- link to projects in github
- Link to your blog and other social media platforms (if relevant)
- explain what Makers Academy is (if they are not a hiring partner they might not know what MA is)
- make your personality stand out
- make sure you've got some white space in your CV - it should be readable
- be aware of using positive rather than negative language e.g. "I had to [do this thing]..." (negative) -> "I had the opportunity to [do this thing]..." (positive)

##### CV Don'ts
- don't include personal information like: DOB, marital status, full address, National insurance number (ID fraud!)
- don't write a bunch of technologies in a meaningless list - contexutualise it in projects. Lots of students use a table to set this out. Feel free to be creative. 
- don't be vague, or generalised

#### STAR technique

A technique you can use to frame evidence about why you’re suitable for a job. This can also be a really useful way to prepare for interviews - for each skill or quality they are looking for, have an example ready to back it up
- Situation... What was the context? e.g. "When I was/ we were..."
- Task... What was required of you? What needed to happen? e.g. "It was my job to... I had the opportunity to... "
- Action... What did YOU actually do? e.g. "So I decided to... "
- Result... What was the outcome as a result of your action? e.g. "As a result..."

#### From a recruiter's perspective

- I am just as interested in the person (whether I want to work with them) as in whether they have the right skills and experience… **be your interesting, human self, demonstrate the right attitude**
- Reading lots of CVs each day can be boring, tiring, time consuming and frustrating and no matter how much we try to be objective, if you’re a human screening CVs, ultimately, you’re making a subjective judgement… **Put yourself in the employer’s shoes, what are they looking for? Spell out why you’re interesting to them, keep language positive**
- I pay more attention to someone’s application if I know the person, or if someone I know has recommended them to me… **get to know the employer, get someone to recommend you, build your network**
- When faced with tonnes of CVs I keep my mind focused by constantly reminding myself what my criteria are. I also look for reasons to bin CVs (mistakes, irrelevant, vague, too long etc)… **start with the requirements of the job and spell out how you meet each one, PROOFREAD, use STAR technique on CV as well as in f2f interviews**
- If I don’t know the applicant (or the person recommending them) I decide if I want to meet someone after I have read their cover letter/CV. … **So see your CV/cover letter as just one of the ways of getting an interview or a tech test. It’s not the be all and end all of your time on earth**
