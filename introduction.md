# Introduction

Your first step to becoming a fully-fledged web developer is now behind you!

The Makers Academy course is a very intense 12 week long immersion course. This course is a balance between you taking responsibility for your own education, letting the coaches know what your needs are and supporting your fellow students during the course.

During this PreCourse phase you will be learning a few of these things as well as getting yourself used to guided self study. It might get confusing and frustrating at times, but that is all part of the process.

### IMPORTANT:
**The PreCourse ensures that you get to the required basic level of competence when you enrol at Makers Academy. This means we'll be monitoring your progress closely to make sure you're getting there. *If by mid-week 3 you haven't completed weeks 1 and 2, you'll be asked to join a later cohort and you'll lose your deposit*.**


## Content

You will be learning basic **Dev Tools** - mostly [Command Line](command_line.md) and [Version Control](version_control.md) with Git - and basic [**Ruby**](ruby.md) so none of that gets in the way when you start the course. It's also the best way to ensure that you and your peers start the course at similar levels.

## Structure

The PreCourse structure is identical to the one you're going to encounter on the 12 weeks of the course, where you'll be working on a new challenge every week.

You can expect 3 emails from us each week:

**Monday** (around 10.30am) - The "official" kickoff of that week's work/challenge. Try to complete it by the following Monday.

**Thursday** (afternoon) -  We'll send you some useful information and it will work as check-in point

## Feedback

Because we're constantly trying to improve and learn from you, we'll ask you to fill out a feedback form every week. It's a tiny form and we really appreciate if you could get yourself to do it every time.

## Communication

You should have received an invite to join our [student Slack](http://makersstudents.slack.com) - please make sure you're signed up to it. We will use this for day-to-day communication.

## Our expectations

Our main expectation is that **you'll be working for a minimum of 20 hours a week for the next 4 weeks (that is before your official start date at Makers Academy).** But we also expect you to:
- Do your best on every challenge
- Be on Slack
- Communicate actively with each other and us
- Follow the [problem solving process](problem_solving.md) when you get stuck
- Help your fellow students whenever you can
- Take care of your own wellbeing
