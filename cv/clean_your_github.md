Clean your Github
=============================

Cleaning all your repos would take months so donâ€™t do that.  Focus on the few repos you are showing off in your CV and your github.

If one of your repos has contributors to it other than you then check with them before doing anything drastic, like deleting it.

Please study the [preparing your code for review pill](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/code_reviews.md) carefully, it has a lot of excellent information.

*What makes a good repo?*
- Descriptive commit messages
- Total test coverage
- Passing tests
- Good code.  Have you run it through a linter and removed all extraneous comments?
- A good README...

*What makes a good README?*
- Outline your approach
- Describe any design patterns or principles you used
- Clarify obstacles you encountered and how you overcame them
- Demonstrate what you learned
- Have badges, [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [Coveralls test coverage](https://coveralls.io/), [CodeClimate code score](https://codeclimate.com/)

Some of the best READMEs can be seen in [Nico Sauressig's Github](https://github.com/NicoSa?tab=repositories). We also have a README [:pill:pill](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/readmes.md)

Also see this Github Review session that Sam (tansaku) did with Nadav from the May '14 Cohort (super thanks to Nadav for being willing to share this!)

Once you've got all that done please follow the advice that Tansaku gave Thomas, which is to think carefully about your classes and the relations they have with each other and ensure you have acceptance tests in place to check the interaction between the objects you create:
